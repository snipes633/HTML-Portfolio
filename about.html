<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Adebisi Adeniyi, an aspiring Full-Stack and Web3 Developer passionate about building dynamic, responsive, and decentralized web applications. Through 'The Complete Web Development Bootcamp' by Dr. Angela Yu, I’ve gained expertise in modern web technologies, including React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, while also diving into the world of blockchain and Web3 development.</p>

<p>I’ve built projects that combine front-end user experiences with secure and scalable back-end systems. My recent focus on Web3 has enabled me to create decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and custom cryptocurrency tokens, leveraging blockchain technologies to drive innovation.</p>

<p>I’m eager to collaborate on impactful projects in Web2 and Web3 spaces, contributing to teams that value innovation and scalability. Let’s connect and explore opportunities to create user-centered, future-ready applications together!</p>
